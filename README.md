# RepoForLLMCondenserPY
I had chatgpt 5 (copilot) create for me a python file that takes an entire repo/directory and collapses all code files and text files into readable text for the LLM to input for it's context window as one text file. (I have not done extensive testing on this tool so let me know what the limits are or any changes that should be made.)
